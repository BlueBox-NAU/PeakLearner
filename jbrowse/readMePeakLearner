###################### 1 OVERVIEW 1 ######################

   This is the readme for the JBrowse section of the PeakLearner webapp. In this readme we will go over how to use the new tools implemented in to jbrowse through peak learner, how to install peak learner and getting it up and running on your own computer, and finally a break down of all of the code used to extend jbrowse to add the functinality PeakLearner needed. If you are looking for any documentation on the server, database, or cluster, it can not be found in this file. The readme going over these elements should be found in the "server" directory.

###################### 2 USE 2 ######################

   PeakLearner allows for interactive labeling of peaks in chip-seq data. This label is then used by our machine learning algorithm to generate a model predicting where any and all other peaks may be in the sample. To add a new label click the highlight located near the top of the page by the search bar of jbrowse, then click and drag over the range you want to highlight. This will add a new label to each track that is currently loaded in to PeakLearner, note even if the track is not selected at the time of highlighting. You can then click on each highlight to cycle through the types of labels. The four kinds of labels are "Peak", "Not a Peak", "Peak Start", and "Peak End". Each of these tells our algorithm a diffrent piece of information. below is a breakdown of what each label does specifically.
   
"Peak" - where a peak is expected, if the model is not showing a peak where there clearly is one, add a "Peak" label to show where a peak should be.

"Not a Peak" - similar to "Peak" this is used to show the algorithm where a peak should not.

"Peak Start" - This points to a region that has where a peak starts but does not nessassarliy end yet

"Peak End" - This is the counter point to "Peak Start" this shows where a peak ends.
